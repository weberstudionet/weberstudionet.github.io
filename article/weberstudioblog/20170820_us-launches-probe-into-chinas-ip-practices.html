<p>&#8220;On Monday, President Trump instructed me to look into Chinese laws, policies and practices which may be harming American intellectual property rights, innovation, or technology development,&#8221; said Mr. Lighthizer in a statement. &#8220;After consulting stakeholders and other government agencies, I have determined that these critical issues merit a thorough investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foreign companies have long complained about Beijing&#8217;s failure to protect know-how and patents, and in some cases forcing firms to share information with domestic partners as the price of doing business in the massive Chinese market. But they also have been timid about pressing hard for their governments to take action, for fear of losing access to China.</p>
<p>But &#8220;Washington will turn a blind eye no longer&#8221;. Mr. Trump insisted last Monday. &#8220;We will safeguard the copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property that are so vital to our security and to our prosperity.&#8221;</p>
<p>America, he added, will no longer tolerate Beijing&#8217;s &#8220;theft&#8221; of US industrial secrets.</p>
<p>Mr Lighthizer is launching the investigation under Section 301 of US trade law, which addresses intellectual property.</p>
<p>The provision gives the president broad authority to impose tariff&#8217;s on foreign goods, though such unilateral action has rarely been used since the creation of the World Trade Organisation in 11995, according to trade experts.</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps the most obvious way to realize that <strong>tariffs make a country poorer</strong> is to realize that tariffs are taxes on domestic citizens, not on foreign producers. In our numerical example, it’s actually misleading to say, “The U.S. government imposes a tax on Japanese car producers,” because <strong>the tax is really applied to American car consumers</strong>. Any revenue that the U.S. government collects from the new tariff has come out of the wallets of Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Lessons for the Young Economist</em>&#8220;. <strong>Authored by</strong>: Robert P. Murphy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Beijing last week fired back at Mr. Trump&#8217;s move, warning that &#8220;everybody will lose&#8221; in the event of a trade war between the world&#8217;s two largest economies.</p>
<p>The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a statement last Tuesday,  15 August 2017, that it &#8220;will resort to all proper measures&#8221; to defend its rights.</p>
<p>The U.S. is China&#8217;s second-largest trading partner after the European Union and it had a deficit of almost $310 billion USD ($423 billion SGD) last year.</p>
<p>The IP issue is the latest source of tension between the two countries, which have seen their relations cool since President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping bonded on a visit to Trump&#8217;s Mar-a-Lago resort earlier this year.</p>
<p>The investigation threatens to further complicate efforts to contain North Korea&#8217;s nuclear threat.</p>
