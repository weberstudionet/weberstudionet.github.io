    <h1>Jail for Cross-dressing in Abu Dhabi</h1>
<p>Two Singaporean men have been condemned to a year-long jail sentence in Abu Dhabi for wearing female attire.</p>
<p>Freelance fashion photographer, <strong>Muhammad Fadli Abdul Rahman</strong>, 26, was in <em>Abu Dhabi</em>, which is the capital city of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), for his work. He was travelling with his friend <strong>Nur Qistina Fitriah Ibrahim</strong>, 37, known to family and friends as &#8220;<em>Fifi</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Fifi is a transgender person whose name has been legally changed, but he has yet to undergo a planned sex-change operation. Speaking to <em>The Straits Times</em>, Nur&#8217;s 34-year-old sister, who wanted to be known only as <strong>Madam Rosy</strong>, said: &#8220;Fifi has not undergone gender reassignment surgery, so her personal documents still state her gender as male. We are worried about her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fadli and Not landed in Abu Dhabi on the 8th of August, and were arrested at a food-court in a shopping mall the next day. The court document, stated in Arabic, that two Singaporean men were caught for wearing women&#8217;s clothes in public and for behaving indecently. Cross-dressing, homosexuality and being a transgender person are crimes in the UAE.</p>
<p>Madam Rosy, said that Nur had been on holiday in the UAE about four times before and had come home safely each time. &#8220;We have a family WhatsApp group and Fifi often sent as messages whenever she was away. This time, she suddenly went silent and this was out of character. A few days later, we received a voice message from her saying she had been arrested. I was shocked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fadli&#8217;s brother, Mr Muhammad Saiful Bahri Abdul Rahman, 32, who works in the property management sector, said his brother was wearing &#8220;a normal white shirt&#8221;. Fadli sent his family a picture of himself, just before he was arrested. He called his father late last night, saying he had been <strong>arrested by the tourism police for wearing earrings</strong>.</p>
<p>Mr Saiful said his family was informed about his brother&#8217;s arrest by Singapore&#8217;s <strong>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</strong> (<strong>MFA</strong>) last week. On Monday, the 21st of August, they were finally informed that Fadli had been sentenced to a year&#8217;s jail on Sunday.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, in an e-mail to the family seen by <em>The Strait Times</em> newspaper, said: &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to hear about this. Rest assured that our consular and mission colleagues will do their best to assist your brother. I understand that they are already in contact with you and your brother. Please let me know if you need further assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Singaporeans were not represented by a lawyer in the court of Abu Dhabi (as was advised by the Embassy) said Mr. Saiful. &#8220;My brother was not present in court and no representative of the Embassy was there either. So he could not have defended himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is said that 15 days after the sentencing on the September 4th&#8217;s judgment, one may appeal the ruling.</p>
<p>Local activist and Fadli&#8217;s roommate, <strong>Vanessa Ho</strong>, stated that she was seeking a lawyer in Abu Dhabi to serve as their solicitor. &#8220;We found that the American Embassy, has a very good handbook about detention in Abu Dhabi. It says citizens have a right to make a phone call home but Fadli has not contacted anyone,&#8221; stated Vanessa Ho.</p>

Their knowledge and experience can come in handy for the ignorance of local laws. Detained in Dubai points out that the UAE had, per population, the largest number of reported Interpol Red Notices (see below in <strong>Extra§</strong>) .</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The UAE has built a tolerant, cosmopolitan image, but the laws continue to reflect the conservative, traditional values of the society. It is not uncommon for visitors to be confused about what is or is not acceptable behaviour.&#8221;, <strong>Radha Stirling</strong> wrote <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fears-safety-pair-arrested-dubai-shopping-mall-radha-stirling">in a post on LinkedIn</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The MFA, in response to queries, said it is aware of the case and that it is rendering consular assistance. &#8220;We are also assisting the family to get legal advice,&#8221; said an unnamed MFA spokesman; while it is reported that Singaporean&#8217;s Embassy&#8217;s advised the two constituents in women&#8217;s attire not to hire a lawyer.</p>
<h3>Extra§</h3>
<p><strong>INTERPOL RED NOTICES</strong> are International requests of co-operation or alerts, allowing police in member countries to share critical crime-related information. In the case of Red Notices, the persons concerned are wanted by the national jurisdictions for prosecution or to serve a sentence based on an arrest warrant, or court decision. INTERPOL&#8217;s role is to assist in identifying and locating these persons with a view to arrest and extradition, or similar lawful action. The imposition of a Red Notice will have a significant impact on those unfortunate enough to be targeted &#8211; especially if featured on INTERPOL&#8217;s public webpage. International travel becomes unsafe, but collateral damage can also be severe; closure of bank accounts; professional and personal reputations become damaged and, in some cases a criminal investigation will ensue.</p>
