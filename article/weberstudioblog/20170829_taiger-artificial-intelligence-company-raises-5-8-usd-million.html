    <h1>Taiger: Artificial Intelligence Company Raises $5.8 USD million</h1>
<p>Taiger, Singapore based artificial intelligence (AI) solutions start-up, has raised $5.8 USD ($8 SGD) million in a Series A funding round led by <a href="http://www.tembusupartners.com/en/index.php/funds/tembusu-ict-fund-i/">Tembusu ICT Fund 1</a> and <a href="https://www.sginnovate.com/">SGInnovate</a>.</p>
<p>As Malaysia is also pushing for deep-learning technology, Singapore has the <a href="https://www.smartnation.sg/">Smart Nation Initiative</a> (<strong>SNI</strong>), with the goal of getting us all our life-long cameo on Big Brother and of course, <em>&#8220;improve living</em>&#8220;.<br />
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='890' height='501' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJmoy41mWDQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div><br />
Taiger will use the financing to pump up sales, research efforts, and expand its presence worldwide. It has branches here, in Spain, the United States, Britain and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009, Taiger specialises in developing &#8220;humanistic&#8221; virtual assistants. Around 2015, Taiger Madrid entered into the Singapore market in hopes of adding their talents of humanising machine interactions with the help of the SNI. Using natural language processing, computational semantics and machine-learning processes, its virtual assistants can interpret and process a range of complex user queries.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tembusupartners.com/en/index.php/funds/tembusu-ict-fund-i/">Tembusu ICT Fund I</a>, the lead investor in the firm is one of the six funds selected by the National Research Foundation of Singapore as part of the Early Stage Venture Fund II scheme. It is also the only deep-tech software-focused venture capital fund in the country. SGInnovate, on the other hand is a government-owned entity which operates under the National Research Foundation as a deep-tech collaboration center.</p>
<p>Playing the Devil&#8217;s advocate, of course the likelihood of the following statement coming true is about as probable as Mexico ever paying for President Donald Trump&#8217;s border-wall. What normally happens is a down-sizing of the labor force, not a retraining and newly structured job descriptions.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re talking about drastic reduction in cost, huge productivity gains, and of course, allowing workers to focus on higher-value work. We’re definitely excited to have Tembusu Partners and SGInnovate on board. Taiger’s vision is very much aligned with Singapore’s Smart Nation Initiative,” said Dr. Sinuhe Arroyo, CEO and Founder, Taiger.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2015 Taiger has come out with an intelligent virtual assistant called iConverse. It used AI around semantic and Natural Language Processing technology to understand users’ spoken and written inputs, convert them into natural language and would speak to them. iConverse was integrated into Singapore government’s public housing projects. Currently Build-to-Order and season parking programs are using the chatbot.</p>
<p>Is it just a migration of legacy databases to a No-SQL database with a few algorithms accessing newly structured data and then some serious UX Designers putting the icing on the cake? Sounds easy enough, but if one thing we have seen in the past, a logical and pragmatic programmer&#8217;s sagacity does not often see beyond the glasses perched on the tip of his nose. This often results in the end-user&#8217;s discomfort, loss of productive time and their eventual dislike, distrust in a system and finally avoidance of using a system.</p>
<p>Three main projects/services  produced by Taiger are;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>iMatch</strong> &#8211; Automatically identifies interprets and extracts information from even unstructured documents.</li>
<li><strong>iConverse</strong> &#8211; Virtual assistant understands the meaning of the user&#8217;s queries, and hence allowing a freer form of communication.</li>
<li><strong>iSearch</strong> &#8211; Semantic search engine that generates Meta-Data automatically; hence, providing relevant and accurate results.</li>
