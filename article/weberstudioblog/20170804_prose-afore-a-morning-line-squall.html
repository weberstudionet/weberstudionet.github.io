    <h1>Prose Afore a Morning Line Squall</h1>
<p>Status: Still in Editing</p>
<blockquote><p>If wishes were horses, then every beggar would ride.<br />
~ Doris Mae Latham-Pinkham<br />
1st July, 1920 unto 19th December 2009</p></blockquote>
<p>MSG and a Prepackaged Powder Society</p>
<p>The call to Fajr was yet to be heard emanating from her mobile phone, sun being yet well below the waterline of the horizon. Rolling over in bed, the visage of my sleeping woman was facing me with that permanent smile of a Gelfling. Time for a coffee, or at least 15% of the powder was coffee, with the rest being expanders, creamer and sweetener straight from the shiny foil sachet laden with Mandarin.</p>
<p>An antipodal in a New York loft was likely either arranging for a non-Kosher meal or as myself, he was crushing up some instant noodles and tossing them into a bowl of boiling water. Yes, it&#8217;s a fine breakfast in confined spaces; however, you can&#8217;t help but imagine how your innards will congeal over years of exposure. And what of the Monosodium Glutamates, aren&#8217;t we all crazy enough?</p>
<p>Got to take advantage of this tropical climate and the fact that unlike the majority in this city, my family has a yard. All these people in flats are placing potted plants in the stair wells, outside their doors and in the common halls. Nebraska has but one growing season per year, the Netherlands industriously cultivates three, which explains why the food is inexpensive and they are Europe&#8217;s biggest wasters of food. Space is what is missed here, but one could grow any heat resistant plant, year round, without concern for anything but the monsoon season.</p>
<p>Calamondin limes, not kaffir limes as they have a bitter after taste and grow with thorns, chili peppers and squash seem to be a good beginning to rebel against society&#8217;s instant packaged powder diet.  My thumbs twist as I wonder where one could acquire a miswak tree to marcot.</p>
<p>Sir Ahmed Salman Rushdie Holds a Thorned Quill</p>
<p>Browsing through the storm of the past night&#8217;s social media, an old Persian friend was compelled to ride his chariot through the midst of the clamour to forewarn me. He had noticed that I was becoming increasingly involved with Islam. No, his inspiration was not due to the recent shroud of xenophobia and lack of understanding entombing the West, that will pass on its own accord. Due to my sense of humor, he was concerned for my welfare.</p>
<p>Being no theologian per say, the Bible, Talmud, to a lesser degree the Kabalah, and wonderous apocryphal books such as the Gospel of Enoch (GoE), have graced my desk. Enoch, who was the great-grandfather of Noah, is record as being taken by the angels to heaven, similar to Muhammad (pbuh). It is no surprise that acceptance of this writing into the canonical Bible, by the Council of Nicaea, 325 AD, was rejected. After all, it is very deep and would have fallen within the pentateuch (first 5 books) and was likely deemed too much for the average mind to digest or accept.</p>
<p>Many years ago, during my undergrad university studies, I had an English translation of the Quran, and never made it past The Cow; the first surah. Somehow I could see light in Revelations and the Gospel of Enoch, but The Cow struck my unintentional arrogance down. It became apparent that understanding the language and the culture, which that language encapsulates, were prerequisites to understanding the meaning behind The Word.</p>
<p>Persians and their way of thinking have always reminded me of the accounts of the Hittite race in both Egyptian and Biblical records. Nabi, he was just as cunning as the Hittites, and had always made a formidable opponent in chess. Nabi, meaning &#8216;prophet&#8217; in Farsi, had sent me a personal message, warning me to tame my tongue and avoid discussing such subjects that may be misconstrued as blasphemy, it could result in death by stoning.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; DEATH by stoning&#8230;. with capital D &amp; S. While the conversion is a game to you, but those guys in Malaysia / Singapore take your conversion serious. Again&#8230;. for f**k sake be careful&#8221;, he wrote, inadvertently proving once again that there are few that truly know me. I always have believed in the God of Abraham, the inevitable judgement to come and that was never taken as a &#8220;game&#8221; in my eyes. It is hard for people to know when I am joking and when not. The safest path is never to jest, but then, if humans become vapid stoic ants in mind and soul, one can plausibly replace humans with androids, without even a need for the Alan Turing&#8217;s test. No disrespect to the Seraphim intended. We all have our place in this expanse.</p>
<p>Troublesome thoughts nonetheless. Every single Apostle, save Iscariot, was murdered; even Barnabas. Apostle John (يوحنا بن زبدي) was poisoned by the Romans, but he would be the only one to survive. By Roman law, he could not be executed again, so he was banished to the Greek island of Patmos, where he wrote the book of Revelations. The general point being; all of these were serious men. Never have I heard of a joke recorded in all my studies, not to say they never had a laugh, and yet all of them were murdered by those who did not agree in their beliefs.</p>
<p>Death by stoning, a form of judgement and execution that could be carried out by even an impoverished and maddened crowd. Pity on the young boy that kindly lead Samson to the main columns of the Philistine&#8217;s courtyard as his parting wish. Then I remembered the death threats on Sir Salman Rushdie for his questionably liberal novels. Who would have thought that being an artist could be so dangerous? Quiet down back there Caravaggio.</p>
<p>They Might Be Giants</p>
<p>The appearance of an email with job offer in the region lifted the gloomy feeling of continued social unrest. Work in the Netherlands had been somewhat difficult in the region I had bought a house, and having been here only a week, it was nice to see that the fish were already biting. Unfortunately, the position was a 24 hour drive from our house, making it impossible to even consider the idea of coming home on weekends. Still, I was feeling blessed, too many coincidences were falling into place, just at the right time and in the right place.</p>
<p>The wife awoke, showered and performed her salat. Her cat, Oreo, inevitably has to pray with her, and perches herself upon the crest of her prayer rug. She wanted company getting to her classroom and with no obligations except for cleaning up my history, why not?</p>
<p>Even the mornings are humid and hot here, so as the metro cars speed up on the rails, a gust of refreshing cool air cools you down. At seven o&#8217;clock in the morning, it is not very crowded. At the crossings between rail-lines, one queues up behind distinct lines, which emphasize that the people exiting the train have the right-of-way. In the line across from us, was a behemoth of an Asian. Heck, it wouldn&#8217;t matter if he was Asian or not, he was simply a very large fellow, even by the average Dutch or Fijian standard.</p>
