    <h1>Singapore’s Fledgling Cashless Society.</h1>

<p>The growing trend towards a cashless society could increase local bank profits by up to 9% over the next two years, according to Maybank Kim Eng Research.</p>
<p>Analyst, Ng Li Hiang said in a research report yesterday that the higher adoption of such payments would increase credit card use which would potentially lift bank revenue. One can surmise this would be due to the increased easy of borrowing with interest accruing.</p>
<p>If 40 to 70% of expenditure in Southeast Asia shifts to forms of cashless payment, bank profits could rise by an estimated 3 to 9% before 2019, said Ms. Ng.</p>
<p>“Most payment platforms adopted by retailers are currently linked to consumers’ cards and/or bank accounts. Based on Euromonitor data, local banks had a combined 66% share of card payment transactions in 2016,” Ms. Ng said. “Our channel checks suggest that the bulk of banks’ card fees come from merchant discount rates and net interchange fees.”</p>
<p>A merchant discount rate is charged to a business by a bank for providing debit and credit card services, while interchange fees are paid by a merchant whenever a customer uses a credit or debit card at their store.</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>“If we assume 70 to 90% of the banks’ card fees in Singapore are related to such fees, we estimate Singapore banks earned between $77 million and $388 million in 2016 (from these fees),” Ms Ng said.</p>
<p>This would reflect a profit margin of between 0.6 and 1.5%. And if 40 to 70% of Singapore’s total expenditure were to shift from cash to cashless payments, that would translate to between $70 and $123 billion SGD worth of transactions moving from paper to plastic.</p>
<p>“We estimate the potential increase in card fees to be around $421 million to $1.96 billion, with Singapore banks to generate profits of $60 to $600 million (from these fees),” Ms. Ng said.</p>
<p>Assuming a profit margin of 1.2%, the local lenders’ net profits could increase by an estimated 3 to 9%, she said.</p>
<p>However, Ms. Ng noted that her analysis was based on certain assumptions that could pan out very differently.</p>
<p>For starters, the amount of customer spending that would shift to cashless payments over the next few years may not hit the 40 to 70% assumed for the analysis.</p>
<p>Ms. Ng, also noted that her analysis assumes that future cashless payments would be conducted with the use of cards.</p>
<p>“This paper only looks at card fees but potential disruption in the payments space can have wider negative implications for banks. We do not know the shape and form of payment disruptions from emerging fintech and/or e-commerce competitors.”</p>
<p>In fact, “banks’ card revenues may shrink should there be mass adoption of cashless payments through bank transfers or banking accounts, which usually do not incur additional charges for merchants and consumers”, she said.</p>
