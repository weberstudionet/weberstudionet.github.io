    <h1>Demise of a Traded Container Company</h1>
<p>Failed container shipping trust Rickmers Maritime has officially sunk after taking on too much water in a badly battered shipping sector. The trust has been wound up and the outstanding bonds will be delisted from the Singapore stock-exchange as of 9:00, Wednesday, 30 August 2017.</p>
<p>It has made final distributions to the unsecured creditors, which represents a recovery of about 12.1%. There will be no further distributions or payments, cash or otherwise, to the unsecured creditors of the trust, including holders of $74 million USD, 8.45% notes due this year, stated the trustee-manager while filing at the exchange on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The outstanding amount due on has been paid to the trustee, DB International Trust (Singapore). This was the final payment to bondholders before the trust sure a was wound up on Aug 16.</p>
<p>The notes trustee will be making arrangements with The Central Depository to credit the relevant distribution amount to each bondholder.</p>
<p>Rickmers Maritime started its winding-up process in April, after debt-restructuring talks failed last December. Bondholders had rejected management&#8217;s appeal to swap the principal on $100 million of notes of 8.45%, which would have been due this May, for $40 million due in November 2023 pegged to much lower coupon rates.</p>
<p>The trust, saddled with heavy debt amid a depressed charter market, had needed to get bondholders on board before bank lenders would allow it to draw on a $260.2 USD ($376 SGD) million facility for refinancing. This has led to defaults, Rickmers said.</p>
<p>Its main lender, HSH Nordbank, later granted Rickmers until April 15 this year to present a new restructuring proposal which would ensure a higher level of total recoveries than under a winding-up process, but the trust failed to find investors to pump in fresh equity. Trading in Rickmers Maritime units has been suspended since last November. The units last traded at a record low of $0.026 SGD.</p>
<p>A bondholder, who declined to be named, told The Straits Times he had been prepared to write off his investment completely &#8220;because of all the drama that erupted over the few months&#8221;. &#8220;Luckily, HSH Nordbank pulled the trigger to liquidate the company. Otherwise, we may not get much back,&#8221; he said, adding that there are bond holders of other firms who may have had it worse.</p>
<p>Rickmers Maritime is but one of several Singapore-listed firms that have struggled with debt over the past year.</p>
<p>In March, oilfield services firm Ezra Holdings filed for US Chapter 11 bankruptcy, following the collapse of Swiber Holdings last year.</p>
<p>More recently, Nam Cheong has defaulted on the $2.25 million coupon and $90 million principal owed to the holders of its Series 002 bonds due on Monday. It also failed to pay the $5 million coupon owed to holders of its $200 million Series 003 bonds, due Saturday, 26 August 2017.</p>
