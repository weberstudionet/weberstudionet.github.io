    <h1>Aerospace, Defense, Construction Products and Electronics spearhead Asian-Pacific market.</h1>
<p>Singapore&#8217;s largest manufacturing stocks have picked up momentum sharply this year and despite popular perception, many of the factories riding high are not electronics manufacturers.</p>
<p>The Singapore Exchange (<a href="http://www.sgx.com/en">SGX</a>) stated in a market update, that 20 of the largest aerospace and defense, construction products, electrical equipment and machinery stocks listed here have averaged a sizzling 37% price gain to the mid-third quarter.</p>

This is far better than the 4.1% price gain they averaged in all of 2016.  In contrast, the 20 largest stocks by market-cap in the Asian-Pacific, including China, in the same manufacturing segments delivered an average price gain of 8% in 2016.</p>
<p>Singapore&#8217;s top 20 regained more than that lost ground, as stocks in Yangzijiang Shipbuilding, <a href="http://www.sembmarine.com">Sembcorp Marine Ltd.</a>, BRC Asia and ISDN reversed declines, SGX said on Tuesday, the 15th of August. Asia-Pacific&#8217;s gains over the same time frame were averaging a lower 10.8%.</p>
<p>In its comparison, SGX focused on the <em>Industrial Sector</em> and excluded electronics manufactures that fall within the <em>Information Sector</em> like Venture.</p>

<p>Within the Industrials Sector, SGX screened for capital goods counters, but excluded industrial conglomerates like <a href="http://www.jardines.com/">Jardine Strategic Holdings</a> and <a href="http://www.kepcorp.com/en/">Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine</a>.</p>
<p>ST Engineering is one of the only two aeroespacial and defense companies on the list of the Asian-Pacific&#8217;s top 20 capital goods manufacturers. SGX reports that while ST Engineering&#8217;s market cap is similar to that of AECC Aviation Power (a Chinese-listed aircraft engine manufacturer), they outperformed AECC since the onset of 2016.</p>
<p>Starburst Holdings, designer of firearms training facilities, was the best performing listed on the SGX, with 115.7% price gains so into the 3rd quarter of 2017. It pulled off a turnaround in the 2nd quarter of 2017, with a reported net profit upwards of around $155,354 USD (€132.320,12 Euro, $212,000 SGD, ¥1,036,840.33 CNY).</p>
<p>&#8220;The Asian-Pacific is the fastest-growing region in terms of defense spending,&#8221; Starburst said in its earnings report filed last week, adding that it is actively responding to tenders for firearms training facilities as the authorities worldwide respond to the threat of terrorism.</p>
<p>Shares in Frencken Group, a precision engineering company that also runs a smaller plastic injection moulding division, have gained 114.6% with in the first 7.5 months of this year.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.frencken.nl">Frencken</a> (see below) posted a 62% jump in net profit to $4.8 USD (€4,12 Euro, $6.6 SGD, ¥32.28 CNY) million, in the last quarter on higher sales from the semiconductor segment. KGI analyst Joel Ng on Tuesday raised his 12-month target price to 73 cents, implying a 40% upside. He noted Frencken&#8217;s improving gross margins, revenue resilience due to a diversified business mix and a potential for higher dividends.</p>
