    <h1>Bodies of Several U.S. Naval Members Located</h1>
<h3>Chinese Media Criticises US Navy for Accidents</h3>
<p>BEIJING</p>
<p>The US Navy&#8217;s two collisions within two months showed that its combat readiness and military management have declined, and it is becoming an increasing risk to shipping in Asia, despite its claims of helping to protect freedom of navigation, an official Chinese newspaper said in an editorial yesterday.</p>
<p>The state-run <i>China Daily</i>, said people will wonder why such a sophisticated navy keeps these problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;The investigations into the collision will take time to reach their conclusions, but there is no denying the fact that the increased activities by the U.S. warships in the Asia-Pacific since Washington initiated its rebalancing to the region are making them growing, risk to commercial shipping, it said.</p>
<p>Reuters, which reported on the said editorial, noted that China has been upset with the freedom of navigation the U.S. enjoys near the Chinese controlled islands within the already disputed area of the South China Sea, building of air-bases and increasing its military presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the U.S. Navy is becoming a dangerous obstacle in Asian waters, China has been making joint efforts with the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) to draw up a code of conduct for the South China Sea, and it has boosted navigational safety by constructing five lighthouses on its islands,&#8221; the <i>China Daily</i> said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone should be able to tell who is to blame for militarising the waters and posing a threat to navigation,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>Another daily, in an editorial late on Monday, said the latest US Navy mishap was met with &#8220;applause from Chinese netizens&#8221;.</p>
<p><i>The Global Times</i>, a nationalistic daily, said that the Chinese reaction &#8220;reflects the sentiment of Chinese society towards the activitives of the US Navy in the South China Sea&#8221;.</p>
<p>It blasted the US Navy for behaving &#8220;arrogantly&#8221; in the region, adding that if it wanted to keep its frequent presence in the waters, it needed to familiarise itself with the large number of merchant vessels that use Asian sea lanes.</p>
<p>A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman yesterday also expressed concern over the &#8220;dangers to freedom of navigation&#8221; in the South China Sea and the related area, and hoped it would be &#8220;dealt with appropriately&#8221;.</p>
<h3>Remains of 10 Sailors Found</h3>
<p>The bodies of some of the 10 missing sailors on board guided-missile destroyer <b>U.S.S. John S. McCain</b>, which had collided with an oil tanker in Singapore waters, have been found after two days of search and rescue efforts.</p>
<p><b>Admiral Scott Swift</b>, commander of the United States Pacific Fleet, told reporters yesterday that US divers discovered the bodies while performing recovery operations in the destroyer, which collided with tanker Alnic MC on Monday, 21st September, morning. Malaysia has also reported the discovery of a body which maybe that of another missing sailor.</p>
<p><span id="more-1573"></span></p>
<p>Admiral Swift, speaking at the Changi Naval Base, where the warship is berthed, said the U.S. was in the process of retrieving the remains from the Malaysia government, North of the strait, for identification.</p>
<p>Sources told <i>The Straits Times</i> that at least three bodies have been found and are awaiting identification.</p>
<p>The <b>Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore</b> (MPA) reported that last evening the search area had been expanded to cover 2,620 sq km. <i>The Straits Times</i> understands that the original search was only 128 sq km.</p>
<p>Singapore and the U.S. are covering the centre of the search area, while Malayslian and Indonesian assets are covering the North and South, respectively, reports the MPA of Singapore, adding that Australia has now joined the search.</p>
<p>On possible causes of the accident, Adm. Swift, who oversees the 7th Fleet, which the USS John S. McCain is part of, said nothing has been ruled out, including cyber sabotage and human error.</p>
<p>&#8220;We owe it to sailors that man the 7th Fleet and their families to answer the questions that flow from the uncertainty of what happened, how could it happen and what can be done to prevent such occurrences in the future,&#8221; Swift said.</p>

<h3>Australia Latest to Join the Search and Rescue Efforts</h3>
<p>Australia is the latest party to join the multi-agency, multinational search and rescue efforts to find the 10 missing sailors from US warship USS John S. McCain.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Australia offered Singapore fixed-wing assets to join the search, which covered an expanded search area of 2,620 sq km.</p>
<p>The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said the Republic has received and accepted offers of help from other countries.</p>
<p>In addition to Australia&#8217;s, Singapore also accepted Indonesia&#8217;s offer to search the northern coastline of <b>Bintan Island</b>, as well as Malaysia&#8217;s offer to send four aircraft to join the expanded search area, including along its coastline. Singapore and the US were covering the centre of the identified search area, while Malaysian and Indonesian assets covered the north and south.</p>
<p>Yesterday, two of the Republic of Singapore&#8217;s Navy patrol vessels, the RSS Gallant and the RSS Fearless, were deployed. The Singapore Police Coast Guard also deployed two vessels. To cover the wider search areas, the Republic of Singapore&#8217;s Air Force deployed a Fokker 50 and a C-130, with a Super Puma helicopter on standby. The MPA also had a craft on the scene.</p>
<p>So far, the Singapore Armed Forces have deployed three patrol vessels, three fast craft, a frigate, two Super Pumas, a Chinook, a C-130 and a Fokker 50, while the coast guard de-ployed four patrol craft. The MPA has deployed two craft, three tug boats and a team of divers.</p>
<p>The MPA has been issuing hourly navigational broadcasts to advise passing vessels of the incident and to request them to keep a lookout for anyone in the water.</p>
<p>At a press briefing yesterday, the commander of th U.S. Pacific Fleet, Admiral Scott Swift, said he was grateful to the Malaysian and Singapore naval forces for their support, singling out Singapore&#8217;s medical help for the five injured sailors, four of whom were evacuated by the Republic.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The medical care has been extraordinary. I talked to the Singapore fleet surgeon in charge of the sailors&#8217; care, and I think the <b>Singapore Government&#8217;s response has just been extraordinary</b>,&#8221; stated Admiral Swift.</p></blockquote>
<p>He declined comment on whether the incident happened in Singapore or Malaysia&#8217;s territorial waters.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think at this point that dialogue is a distraction&#8230; The focus of our navy is on the 10 missing sailors and their families,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The admiral also declined comment on which country was leading the rescue efforts.</p>
